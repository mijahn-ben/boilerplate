# Responsive boilerplate

Primarily for my own use, but decided to maintain this for my colleagues use & anyone else. Feel free to use, fork or whatever. 

The goal is to maintain a simple set of templates, built for mobile, but with desktop view considered.

* Under development!
* Using [html5 boilerplate] (http://html5boilerplate.com/) and will be updating with boilerplate updates if they work for this project
* Yes I am using respond.js - what of it sir?!
